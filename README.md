## AHAAR - ONE BYTE AGAINST WASTE (Backend Documentation)

*Overview*  
AHAAR is a web-based application designed to help users track pantry items, receive expiration alerts, and share excess food to minimize food waste. By providing a comprehensive food management platform, AHAAR aims to reduce household food waste, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable consumption.

### *Problem Statement*  
Household food waste contributes to 8-10% of preventable greenhouse gas emissions globally and incurs an annual economic loss of over $1 trillion. This is often due to poor planning, forgotten items, and lack of community-driven sharing solutions. AHAAR aims to address this by providing a platform to track, manage, and share food items effectively.

### *Why MongoDB Atlas?*

MongoDB Atlas is used for its flexibility, scalability, and real-time capabilities:

- *Document Flexibility*: Stores user data, pantry items, expiration dates, and waste histories efficiently.
- *Scalability*: Handles increasing data demands as the user base grows.
- *Real-Time Notifications*: Sends real-time expiration alerts and sharing notifications.
- *AI Integration*: Supports machine learning and AI features for expiration predictions and recipe suggestions.
- *Security and Reliability*: Ensures secure data storage and real-time access with automated backups and redundancy.

### *Tech Stack*  
- *Frontend*: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- *Backend*: Node.js, Express.js
- *Database*: MongoDB Atlas
- *AI*: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for receipt scanning, GEN-AI for expiration prediction

### *Installation (Backend Setup)*

*Prerequisites*:  
- Node.js and npm installed  
- MongoDB Atlas account  

*Steps to Set Up the Backend*:

1. *Clone the Repository*:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arushi-Gupta13/ahaar-BE.git
    cd backend
    

2. *Install Dependencies*:
    bash
    npm install
    

3. *Set Up Environment Variables*:  
    Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:
    env
    MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-uri
    JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
    PORT=5000
    

4. *Run the Application*:
    bash
    npm start
    

The backend will now be running on port 5000 by default.

### *MongoDB Atlas Usage*

MongoDB Atlas is used for:

- *User Data*: Storing user details such as name, email, password, pantry items, and waste history.
- *Pantry Items*: Each pantry item includes fields such as name, category, expiration date, and quantity.
- *Expiration Alerts*: MongoDB stores data for real-time expiration notifications.
- *Waste History*: Keeps a record of all items thrown away, shared, or consumed, and helps track waste patterns over time.

---

### *AI Features and Integration*

- *Receipt Scanning*: The backend uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scan receipts, extract item names, and add them to the user's pantry.
- *Expiration Prediction*: Machine learning algorithms analyze item categories and expiration patterns to suggest when food will likely expire.

---

### *Contributing*

Contributions are welcome! To contribute to the backend, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Implement your changes and commit them
4. Open a pull request

---

### *Future Improvements*

- *Recipe Suggestions*: Recommend recipes based on pantry items close to expiration.
- *Community Waste Statistics*: Show community-wide impact based on waste data aggregation.
- *Enhanced AI*: Improve the AI to suggest optimized storage methods for different food types and further reduce waste.
